# TaylorCouetteHonorsThesis
This Repository includes the files used to drive the stepper motor pair, and MATLAB scripts to Reynold's and Taylor Numbers based on input parameters.
Note that the stepper motor code is virtually identical across the two files, barring the selected BAUD rate. This is because the motors are expected to run together, but write to separate consoles within the Arduino IDE.
